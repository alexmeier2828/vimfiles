# Alex's Vim Configuration 
This repository is a place for me to store my ever changing and ever growing vim configuration.  If anyone would like to use this config, please, help yourself.  

## Requirements 
* This config comes preloaded with the vim Plug plugin manager, which I believe requires a git installation to work properly.
* Powerline fonts - For the aesthetic.

## Using This Config Conveniently
I find the best way to set this up, assuming you are on a unix like system, is to create a symbolix link fro your vim config folder, whether that be .config/nvim, or .vim.
